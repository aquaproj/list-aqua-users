## How is the list generated?

The list is updated by GitHub Actions hourly.

https://github.com/aquaproj/list-aqua-users/actions/workflows/update-readme.yaml

The list is generated by searching the phrase `aquaproj/aqua-registry` with [GitHub Search Code API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28#search-code) and getting each repository's GitHub Star count by [GitHub GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/graphql).

:warning: Note that this list isn't necessarily accurate.

- The list doesn't include repositories not using the Standard Registry [aquaproj/aqua-registry](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry)
- The list includes repositories that include the phrase `aquaproj/aqua-registry` in the code but don't use aqua actually
