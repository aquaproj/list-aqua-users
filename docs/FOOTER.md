## How does it work?

The list is updated by GitHub Actions daily.
The list is generated by searching codes with [GitHub Search Code API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28#search-code) and getting each repository's GitHub Star count by [GitHub GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/graphql).
